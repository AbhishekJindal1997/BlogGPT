Ugandan Border Town Mourns School Attack Victims as Security Heightens

The town of Mpondwe-Lhubiriha in Uganda is in mourning following a brutal attack on Lhubiriha Secondary School that left 42 people dead, most of them students. The victims were buried on Sunday, as authorities increased security patrols along the Congolese border. The school, located just over a mile from the frontier, was attacked on Friday night by suspected extremist rebels wielding guns and machetes. In addition to the 38 students killed, a school guard and three civilians also lost their lives. At least six students are believed to have been abducted by the attackers and taken back into Congo.

The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, condemned the incident and stressed the importance of collective efforts, including enhanced regional partnerships, to tackle cross-border insecurity between Congo and Uganda and restore peace in the area. The Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, vowed to deploy more troops on the Ugandan side of the border to prevent further attacks.

The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a group with ties to the Islamic State, is believed to be responsible for the attack. In recent years, the ADF has been accused of many similar attacks in remote parts of eastern Congo, including one in March that claimed 19 lives. The group was formed in the early 1990s by some Ugandan Muslims who felt marginalized by Museveni's policies. They have since staged several deadly attacks in Uganda, including a 1998 massacre of 80 students in a town not far from the site of Friday's raid.

The attackers targeted two dormitories, using extreme force when the students resisted. Education Minister Janet Museveni, who is also Uganda's first lady, said, "This terrorist group couldn't enter, so they threw in a bomb, they threw in a petrol bomb. So, these children were burnt." Schools are considered soft targets, and students are sometimes recruited into rebel ranks or used to carry supplies for insurgents.

The attack caught Ugandan authorities off guard, with first responders arriving after the attackers had left. Some villagers have temporarily relocated from the Mpondwe-Lhubiriha community, fearing more attacks. The porous border and lawlessness of eastern Congo have allowed groups like the ADF to operate since the central government in Kinshasa has limited authority in the region. However, attacks by the ADF on the Ugandan side of the border are rare, partly due to the presence of an alpine brigade of Ugandan troops.

Ugandan forces have been deployed in eastern Congo since 2021 as part of a military operation to hunt down ADF militants and prevent them from attacking civilians across the border. This deployment followed suicide bombings by suspected ADF members in Kampala, Uganda's capital, in November 2021. President Museveni believes that military pressure on the rebels in Congolese territory has forced them to splinter into smaller groups, such as the one that attacked the school, in an attempt to draw Ugandan forces away from the border.

Museveni stated, "Especially now that the Congo government allowed us to operate on the Congo side also, we have no excuse in not hunting down the ADF terrorists into extinction." As Uganda and its regional partners work towards restoring peace and security in the area, the world watches on, hoping for an end to the senseless violence against innocent civilians.
Ugandan Town Begins Burying Victims of Brutal School Attack

A grief-stricken town near the Ugandan border has begun burying the victims of a horrific school attack carried out by suspected extremist rebels. The brutal assault on Lhubiriha Secondary School left 42 people dead, most of them students, and has prompted increased security patrols along the frontier with volatile eastern Congo.

The attack took place on Friday night, with 38 students among the victims, as well as a school guard and three civilians. The attackers, armed with guns and machetes, targeted the co-ed, privately-owned school, which is located just over a mile from the Congo border. Some students were burned beyond recognition, while others were shot or hacked to death. Additionally, Ugandan authorities believe that at least six students were abducted and taken across the border as porters.

In response to the attack, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized the importance of collective efforts and enhanced regional partnerships to address cross-border insecurity between Congo and Uganda and restore peace in the area. Meanwhile, Ugandan security forces have been patrolling the streets near the school, which is currently under police protection.

The attack is believed to have been carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a group with established ties to the Islamic State. While the ADF does not usually claim responsibility for attacks, it has been accused of numerous assaults targeting civilians in remote parts of eastern Congo. The group has long opposed Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986 and is a key U.S. security ally.

In the wake of the attack, President Museveni has vowed to deploy more troops on the Ugandan side of the border to combat the ADF. Ugandan forces have already been stationed in eastern Congo since 2021 as part of a military operation to hunt down ADF militants and prevent attacks on civilians across the border. The deployment followed a series of suicide bombings in Kampala in November 2021, which left four civilians dead and were believed to have been carried out by ADF members.

However, the ADF has managed to exploit the lawlessness of eastern Congo, where the central government has limited authority, in order to continue its operations. Attacks on the Ugandan side of the border are relatively rare, thanks to the presence of an alpine brigade of Ugandan troops in the region. Nevertheless, the porous border and multiple unmonitored footpaths facilitate cross-border attacks, such as the one on Lhubiriha Secondary School.

The recent attack has sown fear in local communities, with some villagers temporarily relocating to escape potential further assaults. In order to counter this growing threat and restore peace in the region, concerted efforts must be made to increase cross-border cooperation and enhance security measures. Strengthening regional partnerships and addressing the systemic issues that allow groups like the ADF to thrive are crucial steps towards creating a safer environment for civilians and preventing future tragedies.

Title: Ugandan Border Town Mourns 42 Victims in Brutal School Attack

The Ugandan border town of Mpondwe-Lhubiriha has begun the process of mourning and burying the victims of a recent school attack, which left 42 people dead, most of them students. The attack is suspected to have been carried out by Islamic extremist rebels, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), who have established ties with the Islamic State group. As the town grieves, security forces have increased their patrols along the volatile border with eastern Congo. 

On Friday night, armed militants with guns and machetes attacked Lhubiriha Secondary School, a co-ed and privately-owned institution located close to the Congo border. The assailants killed 38 students, a school guard, and three civilians, while eight others were left wounded. Some students were burned beyond recognition, while others were shot or hacked to death. Ugandan authorities believe at least six students were kidnapped and taken as porters back into Congo.

In a statement, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the attack and emphasized the importance of collective efforts, including enhanced regional partnerships, to address cross-border insecurity between Congo and Uganda and restore durable peace in the area.

The atmosphere in Mpondwe-Lhubiriha remains tense but calm, with Ugandan security forces patrolling the streets, as well as the school, which is now protected by a police cordon. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in his first comments on the incident, described the attack as "criminal, desperate, terrorist, and futile," vowing to deploy more troops on the Ugandan side of the border. 

The ADF has a history of targeting civilians in remote parts of eastern Congo, including an attack in March that claimed 19 lives. The group was established in the early 1990s by some Ugandan Muslims who felt marginalized by Museveni's policies. Since then, the ADF has carried out numerous deadly attacks in Ugandan villages and the capital, such as the 1998 massacre of 80 students in a town not far from the site of Friday's raid.

The recent attack appears to have followed a similar pattern of violence against students, with the assailants targeting two dormitories and using extreme force when met with resistance. Schools are considered soft targets, and attacks like these often provide the media coverage sought by extremist groups. The raid also appears to have caught Ugandan authorities by surprise, with first responders arriving only after the attackers had fled.

With fears of more attacks, some villagers have temporarily moved away from the Mpondwe-Lhubiriha community. The border region is porous, marked by lawless areas in eastern Congo that allow groups like the ADF to operate with limited interference from the central government in Kinshasa. However, the ADF's attacks on the Ugandan side of the border are rare, partly due to the presence of an alpine brigade of Ugandan troops in the region. 

Since 2021, Ugandan forces have been deployed to eastern Congo to hunt down ADF militants and prevent them from attacking civilians across the border. This deployment followed a series of suicide bombings in Kampala, the country's capital, in November 2021, which were believed to have been carried out by ADF members. 

Ugandan President Museveni believes that military pressure on the rebels deep within Congolese territory has forced them to splinter into smaller groups, such as the one that attacked the school. Their aim is to "force us to withdraw our Army to defend the Uganda villages and that would save them from the losses they are now suffering," he said. Museveni remains resolute in his commitment to hunt down the ADF terrorists, stating, "Especially now that the Congo government allowed us to operate on the Congo side also, we have no excuse in not hunting down the ADF terrorists into extinction."

As the border town of Mpondwe-Lhubiriha continues to bury the victims of this tragic attack, the international community must work together to address cross-border insecurity and forge stronger regional partnerships. Through shared efforts and determination, it is hoped that such senseless acts of violence can be prevented in the future, and that a lasting peace can be achieved in the region.
A small Ugandan border town, Mpondwe-Lhubiriha, is mourning the brutal attack on Lhubiriha Secondary School on Friday night that left 42 people dead, most of them students. The town has begun burying the victims as security forces step up patrols along the frontier with the volatile eastern Congo. Among the casualties, 38 students, a school guard, and three civilians were killed in the attack. The assailants, believed to be extremist rebels, were armed with guns and machetes.

In addition to the deaths, at least six students were abducted and taken as porters back inside Congo. The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, condemned the attack and called for collective efforts, including enhanced regional partnerships, to tackle cross-border insecurity between Congo and Uganda and restore durable peace in the area.

The atmosphere in Mpondwe-Lhubiriha remains tense but calm as Ugandan security forces patrol the streets outside and near the school, which is now protected by a police cordon. The attack is blamed on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a group with established ties to the Islamic State. The ADF rarely claims responsibility for attacks and has been accused of launching many attacks targeting civilians in remote parts of eastern Congo in recent years.

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in his first comment on the incident, described the attack as "criminal, desperate, terrorist and futile," vowing to deploy more troops on the Ugandan side of the border. Museveni, a U.S. security ally, has been in power since 1986. The ADF was established in the early 1990s by some Ugandan Muslims who felt sidelined by Museveni's policies. The group has since staged deadly attacks in Ugandan villages and the capital, including a 1998 attack in which 80 students were massacred in a town not far from Friday's raid.

The attackers in the recent raid targeted two dormitories, using extreme force when the boys resisted. Education Minister Janet Museveni, also Uganda's first lady, said, "This terrorist group couldn't enter, so they threw in a bomb, they threw in a petrol bomb. So, these children were burnt." Students were targeted because schools are considered soft targets, and such raids provide media coverage coveted by extremists. Additionally, pupils are sometimes recruited into rebel ranks or used to carry food and supplies for insurgents.

The attack appears to have caught Ugandan authorities by surprise, with first responders arriving only after the assailants had left. Some villagers have temporarily left the Mpondwe-Lhubiriha community, fearing more attacks. The area's porous border and lawless parts in eastern Congo allow groups like the ADF to operate, as the central government in Kinshasa has limited authority there.

However, attacks by the ADF on the Ugandan side of the border are rare, partly due to the presence of an alpine brigade of Ugandan troops in the region. Ugandan forces have been deployed to eastern Congo since 2021 to hunt ADF militants and stop them from attacking civilians across the border.

He is determined to hunt down the ADF terrorists, stating, "Especially now that the Congo government allowed us to operate on the Congo side also, we have no excuse in not hunting down the ADF terrorists into extinction."

As the community grapples with the aftermath of this tragic attack, regional and international cooperation is crucial in addressing the threat posed by extremist groups like the ADF. Strengthening border security and addressing the root causes of extremist violence will play a vital role in preventing such incidents in the future and ensuring long-term peace and stability in the region.
Mpondwe-Lhubiriha, a Ugandan border town, is mourning the brutal attack on the Lhubiriha Secondary School by suspected extremist rebels, which resulted in 42 deaths, including 38 students. The town has begun burying the victims as security forces increase patrols along the border with volatile eastern Congo. One of the eight wounded individuals from the attack died overnight, according to Selevest Mapoze, the town's mayor.

The attackers, armed with guns and machetes, targeted the privately-owned co-ed school located just over a mile from the Congo border. The students were either burned beyond recognition, shot, or hacked to death. Ugandan authorities believe that at least six students were abducted and taken as porters back inside Congo.

The border between Uganda and Congo is porous, with multiple footpaths unmonitored by authorities. Eastern Congo is a lawless region where groups like the ADF can operate due to the central government's limited authority. However, attacks by the ADF on the Ugandan side of the border are rare, partly due to the presence of an alpine brigade of Ugandan troops in the region.

Ugandan forces have been deployed to eastern Congo since 2021 to hunt down ADF militants and prevent them from attacking civilians across the border.

The tragic attack on Lhubiriha Secondary School highlights the ongoing struggle against extremist groups like the ADF in the region and the need for collective efforts to address cross-border insecurity. As authorities step up security measures and seek to bring those responsible to justice, the community of Mpondwe-Lhubiriha must come to terms with the loss of their young ones and work together to ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again.
