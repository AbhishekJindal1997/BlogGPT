"Netflix and chill" is an Internet slang term used as a euphemism for sexual activity, either as part of a romantic partnership, as casual sex, or as a groupie invitation. Since its first recorded, nonsexual use in a tweet posted in 2009,[1][2] the phrase has gained popularity within the Twitter community and other social media sites like Facebook and Vine. By 2015, "Netflix and chill" had become an Internet meme and its use on teenage social media was commonly described as "sexual" by Fusion.[1] I'm about to log onto Netflix and chill for the rest of the night. 21 January 2009[3] The first recorded use of the phrase "Netflix and chill" was in a Twitter post by "NoFaceNina" (La Shanda Rene Foster) on January 21, 2009. It said, "I'm about to log onto Netflix and chill for the rest of the night."[1][2] Early use of the phrase was without sexual connotations, referring simply to the act of watching the online streaming service, typically by oneself.[4] By 2013, Netflix's popularity in the US had risen greatly, having accumulated millions of paid subscribers, increasing verb use of the brand and this phrase as a standalone compound noun. The euphemistic nature of the phrase is believed to have been established in mid-2014,[4] and by the end of the year had spread throughout the Black Twitter community, as seen by many now typing chill within scare quotes. In April 2015, a definition of the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary stating that it meant "code for two people going to each other's houses and [having sexual intercourse] or doing other sexual related acts".[1][4] Soon, the term would spread beyond the Black Twitter community, becoming an Internet meme and gaining the attention of news websites such as The Guardian[4] and the Daily Mirror.[5] As the phrase entered into common lexicon, events, products, and services associated with the phrase started to emerge, including acknowledgement from Netflix itself.[6] In September 2015, a joke app in the style of Tinder had been created for users to organize "Netflix and chill" sessions.[6] At two separate universities, students planned "Netflix and chill" festivals, with one being canceled by authorities as they believed too many people would be in attendance.[7] During the World Maker Faire in New York, Netflix unveiled a prototype for a large button called "The Switch", which, when pressed, will dim the lights in the users' residence, activate the "Do Not Disturb" feature on their cell phones, and prepare Netflix for streaming—eliminating most distractions from their activities. This has been frequently referred to as the "Netflix and chill button".[8] In October 2015, entrepreneur Kori Williams created and sold a line of condoms named Netflix and Chill. The condoms were approved by the FDA for use to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.[9][10][11] In November 2015, the Netflix logo outside the company's headquarters in Los Gatos, California had been spray-painted to add the words "and chill".[12] In December 2015, Ariana Grande released the holiday EP Christmas & Chill, its title a seasonal variation on "Netflix and chill".[13] In January 2016, artist Tom Galle and company ART404 created a "Netflix & Chill Room" in New York City for rent on Airbnb.[14] In early February 2016, Netflix released the results of a survey on how users in relationships use their service, described as a "Netflix and chill study".[15] The results were accompanied with a series of social media posts with the hashtag "#DatingWithNetflix" promoting the idea of a positive impact for couples using the service.[16] In June 2016, singer-songwriter Danah released a song titled "Netflix and Chill" on SoundCloud. The track was produced by Wippy Lion, a member of Australian pop group Justice Crew. The song is a tongue-in-cheek representation of the term's use in popular culture.[17] In January 2020, Ben & Jerry's announced a new ice cream flavor called "Netflix & Chilll'd".[18] "Netflix and chill" inspired the name Stream and Chill for the Danish radio talk-show about streaming and TV-series. Stream and Chill is a Radio4 original program with radiohost William Ejsing. Stream and Chill has been on air since 2019.[19] "RBB and chill" is a spoof of "Netflix and chill", used as a commercial slogan by the regional Public Service Broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg in the north-east of Germany, mainly on billboards across the German capital of Berlin.[20]
A relationship expert breaks down the sexual innuendo and shares what you should say instead. "Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?" Harry Styles asks in his smooth and sultry song "Woman." Is he talking about an innocent movie date night with a crush, or hinting at a rendezvous set to the tune of Set it Up?  Who’s to say, but one thing's for sure: "Netflix and chill" has become slang for inviting someone over to casually hook up.  While nearly any phrase can be heard as an euphemism with the right inflection (my friends and I use the classic, "Did you go up to their apartment for a glass of water?"), this kind of language can be vague and unhelpful in sexual situations where consent is crucial. "Using coded language like 'Netflix and chill' assumes that we don’t have to be clear about our sexual expectations or intentions," says Michelle Herzog, LMFT and founder of The Center For Modern Relationships in Chicago. "It releases us from personal accountability as it provides an out for a lot of folks who struggle with being direct about what they want or don’t want."  Instead, she encourages daters to make their intentions and desires clear—even if it feels awkward to say something like, "I’m really attracted to you. How do you feel about exploring this relationship sexually?" It might seem scary to broach the topic in such a straightforward way, but the benefits ultimately outweigh the risks. You'll get a clear answer, know where you stand with the other person, and can then actually focus on whatever you're watching on Netflix with them. Still, if you're intrigued by the popular phrase and curious about its current relevance (or, ahem, lack thereof), here's everything you need to know: Flashback to 2009 when people used Twitter to log mundane personal updates (essentially its original use, ICYDK). User @NoFaceNina tweeted, "I’m about to Netflix and chill for the rest of the night" sans any kind of sexual connotation. So pure. So wholesome.  I'm about to log onto Netflix and chill for the rest of the night. Then, the internet did its thing, gave the phrase the meme treatment, and "Netflix and chill" took on a life of its own. By 2015, it was defined on Urban Dictionary as, "When you go to your partner’s house and watch Netflix which then escalates to sexual activities." Even Netflix itself played into the innuendo that year, tweeting out "Netflix and chill? No, really." with a GIF from Clueless. The rest was history, as they say.  Netflix and chill? No, really. pic.twitter.com/ezcZ7V0peN "Netflix and chill" has lost some—if not all—of its innuendo, simply because most people (unless you’re Drew Barrymore) know what it means. Yet, even if it’s not used sincerely and instead said in a tongue-in-cheek way, the phrase can still be interpreted as sexually suggestive. At the same time, it’s now normal to use it literally when suggesting a movie night with a friend.  Still, Herzog cautions against using coded language of any kind with potential sexual partners. "Toxic dating culture has taught us that it’s 'safer' to be indirect about what we are seeking from the people we date," she says. "But you should never feel pressured to be sexual because you’ve been invited over to 'watch a movie'." Watch this to find out Joey King's go-to show when Netflix and chilling: If you’re hit with that "Netflix and chill"-type language, take a moment to check in with yourself about what sexual activitiy—if any—you’d be comfortable with so you can establish clear boundaries with your date. This willingness is a flagship marker of consent, Herzog says. Normalize having straightforward conversations about sexual interest, rather than relying on euphemisms that can easily be misunderstood or unwanted. She suggests a matter-of-fact approach, like "I don't feel ready to explore our relationship sexually just yet, but I enjoy spending time with you and would like to continue getting to know you better."  And if you can’t wait to jump this person’s bones? Great! Share that, too. "Self-advocacy sets all of us up for creating healthy relationships from the beginning and keeps us out of the guessing game," Herzog says. This way, both parties are active participants in deciding what works or doesn’t, no matter if you’re casual or committed.
