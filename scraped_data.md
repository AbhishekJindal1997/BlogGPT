If you are someone who is in need of adult diapers for any reason, you are not alone. Millions of Americans live with medical conditions that require them to use adult diapers in order to live unrestricted lives with the freedom to go in public or to rest comfortably in their own homes without fear of accidents. For many, adult diapers have benefits that are life changing. But those benefits come at a cost. The best adult diapers are highly discreet, absorbent and effective. They can also cost up to $4,000 per year -- roughly $350 every month. Those people living on a fixed income or dealing with other monthly medical expenses should not have to choose which home care supplies to buy. Luckily there are many resources that provide financial assistance for adult diapers and home care supplies. By using these resources, you can qualify for reduced cost or even free adult diapers. Some require a little work, but the deals you find will be more than worth it. You may even be able to select the brand you use in some cases, meaning that you can still have access to the best adult diapers on the market today without breaking the bank. We have looked into the top resources that will connect you with the best adult diapers for free or reduced cost. Depending on where you live, there are often local resources that are established to help those with financial need afford basic medical necessities including diapers for adults. Especially if you live in a larger city, you may find that there is a dedicated organization whose mission fits your needs. Search for nonprofits in your area that help with medical expenses for those who are elderly or who have chronic diseases or debilitating injuries. Other nonprofits may provide more general assistance for those in need. These groups may be able to award funding that can be used to purchase adult diapers. Local hospitals may also have donations of products from those who have a stock they no longer need. Former caregivers or family members who have lost their loved one are frequent donors of these products. There may even be a local diaper bank in your area that serves adults. While you may not be able to choose the exact brand or type of diaper you get, you can usually get access to diapers if you are in need. The National Diaper Foundation has created this resource to help find diaper banks. And the Simon Foundation has compiled a helpful directory of possible diaper banks for adults. Be sure to call the diaper bank to find out more information. Their inventory can change often and some only offer infant diapers and do not have adult diapers. There are specific agencies set up to help people who are elderly, disabled, veterans or those who are classified as low income. By connecting with those nonprofits or organizations who make it their mission to help people like you, you have a better chance at getting the assistance you need to afford the best diapers. Here are a few places to start your search for the best free or reduced cost diapers: Discount drug cards are widely available from different sources and were developed to help those without insurance afford their prescriptions. These cards have greatly expanded their coverage since they were first introduced and they now regularly cover over-the-counter medications and home care supplies, including adult diapers. If you are paying out of pocket for adult diapers or other incontinence products, simply present the card and inquire about the discount at the time of your purchase. Purchasers paying out-of-pocket for home care supplies should always present their card and ask for a discount on any type of home care product regardless of if a prescription is required. Each card will offer its own unique discount, so be sure to shop around for the best deals for the brand of adult diapers that you prefer. Search online to find coupons that cover your favorite brands of adult diapers. These coupons can often be found online or in coupon books and are one of the easiest ways to get great discounts or even free products from the best adult diaper producers in the market.

Facebook is especially popular for crowd sourcing the materials and products you need. If your city or neighborhood has a Group page or other messaging group, why not ask if others have the products you are looking for? Or ask about local resources for the elderly or chronically ill. Or you can easily search postings to find resources that others have posted about. You will be surprised how many others may need the same resources you are looking for. While your local nursing home probably will not have products to offer you for free, they probably can point you in the right direction if you aren’t having any luck in other ways. Just contact their office and see if you can speak to someone who works with residents to find out if they know of any places that can help you find free or discounted diapers for adults.

Adult diapers are the best way to deal with urinary incontinence. The strain the condition places on those suffering from it and their caregivers is greatly reduced. Urinary incontinence is common among the elderly, but it could happen to anyone, at any age. 15 to 20% of the elderly are affected by urinary incontinence. The figures for those with chronic medical conditions or who are in care homes can go up to 70%. Obesity, multiple pregnancies, surgeries, medications including diabetic drugs are the common causes of the condition. Strokes and cognitive impairment are other risk factors.  There is nothing to be embarrassed about in wearing an adult diaper – they are simply products developed to improve the quality of life, just like using a walking stick to aid mobility. While adult diapers can give a person with incontinence problems the freedom to enjoy life without worrying about leakage or the need to go to the bathroom frequently, how effective they depend on their proper use. If you use adult diapers or have a loved one who does, here are a few dos and don’ts to help get the maximum benefit from them. Adult diapers are meant to give you back your freedom and confidence. If you are unsure about using them or have questions about the usage, talk to a geriatrician who will be able to give you the advice and guidance you need to find the right diaper, wear it correctly and return to greater enjoyment of life.   Kauvery Hospital is globally known for its multidisciplinary services at all its Centers of Excellence, and for its comprehensive, Avant-Grade technology, especially in diagnostics and remedial care in heart diseases, transplantation, vascular and neurosciences medicine.

Disposable absorbent underwear products, sometimes called “adult diapers” or briefs, help those living with urinary incontinence and/or bowel incontinence keep their symptoms from interfering with daily life. There are many kinds of incontinence supplies to choose from, but finding the right one can be tricky.Receiving an Incontinence DiagnosisIf a senior is experiencing a loss of bladder or bowel control, it is very important to consult a medical professional who can properly diagnose the type of incontinence, rule out any serious underlying causes and recommend treatment options. Even if behavioral changes, medications, surgery or other interventions are appropriate, a senior will may still need to use incontinence supplies to manage leaks and continue participating in their normal routines.Finding the Right Diaper for Adults with IncontinenceThere are many factors to consider when choosing an absorbent product, including:Leakage type (e.g., urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, or both)Leakage amount and corresponding absorbency and coverage levelsFlexibility to accommodate one’s varying activity levelsUnisex or gender-specific productsSizeStyle (e.g., tab-style or pull-on)Disposable or reusableOne’s mobility, dexterity and functional independence regarding activities of daily living like dressing/undressing, toileting and continence careCostPersonal preferences and comfortAppearance under clothingSome trial and error is usually necessary to determine how well a specific product works and how comfortable it is to wear. You may find that one product is best for containing leaks overnight, another has a slimmer profile under clothing for outings during the day, and a third more flexible option is ideal for activities like walking and light exercise.Incontinence supplies can be expensive, especially at the beginning when you’re buying multiple brands and styles to find the best possible solution. Try not to look at the price tags first and choose contenders based on the factors above instead. You may find that a pricier product is more durable and provides better protection, therefore requiring fewer changes and costing less in the long run. (Better absorption and protection can also prevent you from constantly having to launder soiled clothes and linens and clean furniture and floors.) Keep in mind that many incontinence product manufacturers offer free or low-cost samples and coupons that can help you through the discovery phase and defray costs once you settle on something you like.Caregiver Tips for Choosing Adult Incontinence BriefsSince there are so many factors that play into finding the “best” incontinence underwear, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, family caregivers can learn a great deal from one another by sharing real experiences and insights that help shorten the trial-and-error process. The following tips are real pieces of advice that have been shared on the Caregiver Forum.“I searched the Internet and got sample packs from various brands. Some were free samples, some I had to pay a nominal fee for, but getting the samples allowed me to visually see how they fit [without having to buy a whole package]. We ended up with Tranquility Premium OverNight Disposable Absorbent Underwear (pull-on style) for Dad. Tranquility also offers inserts that give an extra layer of protection used in conjunction with the regular disposable underwear. No underwear is going to be 100% leak-proof, but it is rare that Dad leaks with the Tranquility Premium OverNights. It’s worth the extra money.” –4him4Him“[Adult incontinence briefs] shouldn’t leak, but they do. A key issue is if the diaper/pull-up/brief has been peed in prior—even a little. The gel-like substance that is supposed to absorb won’t a second time. Nighttime is problematic and the laying down position doesn’t help matters. Gravity just doesn’t work that way. My conclusions? Some brands work better than others but they ALL leak. Although some swear by doubling diapers, it’s a waste. Pad inserts help best, especially for men when you can adjust and aim when putting on. (Sorry, you know what I mean).” –Rainmom“My mom is tiny, so even the small size of Depend briefs don’t fit tightly enough around the leg holes and sometimes she leaks. At night, we put two Poise pads in her Depend, so that if she wets the top layer, we only have to remove that pad rather than change the whole set. During the day, she wears one Poise pad in a cotton brief, which is snug enough that she doesn’t leak.” –CatyRay“My Dad wears the Depend ‘Real Fit’ incontinence underwear for men, which he likes much better than the regular Depend. For women, I think they are called Depend ‘Silhouette.’ ” –freqflyer“I was given some diapers for my husband that were actually for women, but I used them and I found that they seemed to be a bit better than the men’s! It seemed they come up higher on his back.” –Cathy2014“NorthShore Care Supply’s AirSupreme Tab-Style briefs are super absorbent and, if they fit properly, don’t leak. It is all about the fit in the waist and the legs. Both should be snug, but not so tight as to make indentations on the skin. If your loved one has an unusual body type, like thinner legs and thicker waist, or vice versa, many incontinence supplies providers have a quiz or product finder tool on their websites to help consumers find the right product and fit.” –Chateau“Don’t get the pull-on type diapers for a bedridden patient. Get the ones with tape [or velcro] tabs on the sides.” –SueC1957“There are so many sizes and absorbencies available as well as many different brands that you should be able to find something your loved one likes. Take some time to check out the websites of brands like Depend, Always, Tena and whatever other products are easily available. They are full of information about their products and some even provide free/cheap samples and customer service help. If your loved one really can’t/won’t change frequently, then you will probably need to order one of the premium products. If you are going to add a pad to a brief for extra absorbency, you need to look for BOOSTER pads that don’t have the leak-proof backing. Unless you slash the outer layer on a traditional pad, nothing can pass though the soaked product other than what overflows around the edges. Lastly, most of us resist the pull ups because they cost a lot more, but I think they are the only way to contain bowel incontinence.” –cwillie“My mom (who is in bed or in her wheelchair at all times) uses a Walmart brand called Assurance Unisex Stretch Brief with tabs and adds a Certainty Women’s Bladder Control Pad in Ultimate Absorbency from Walgreens. I do not use these for their lower cost as it’s what we grabbed day one when we knew nothing, and they have worked very well since. I know how important skin integrity and UTI prevention are, so I would not have kept using these brands if they didn’t work well.” –Momheal1Browse Our Free  Senior Care GuidesPrioritize Skin IntegritySkin care is an important part of incontinence care that cannot be overlooked. In addition to prompt changing of soiled briefs and liners, private areas must be gently yet thoroughly cleansed and dried. Repeated exposure to urine and fecal matter can be very damaging to sensitive skin. Improper care may lead to rashes, sores and even serious infections. Look for incontinence products that effectively trap and wick moisture away from the skin and feature soft, breathable lining. Application of a skin barrier ointment can further protect the area from moisture and prevent irritation.Read: Bathing & Hygiene Tips: Caring for a Senior’s Aging SkinShopping for Adult Incontinence Products OnlinePeople are often embarrassed to purchase incontinence products in person at their local stores.

I do not use these for their lower cost as it’s what we grabbed day one when we knew nothing, and they have worked very well since.

In addition to prompt changing of soiled briefs and liners, private areas must be gently yet thoroughly cleansed and dried. Repeated exposure to urine and fecal matter can be very damaging to sensitive skin. Improper care may lead to rashes, sores and even serious infections. Look for incontinence products that effectively trap and wick moisture away from the skin and feature soft, breathable lining. Application of a skin barrier ointment can further protect the area from moisture and prevent irritation.Read: Bathing & Hygiene Tips: Caring for a Senior’s Aging SkinShopping for Adult Incontinence Products OnlinePeople are often embarrassed to purchase incontinence products in person at their local stores. Fortunately, there are plenty of online retailers that sell incontinence supplies and other elder care products and offer discreet shipping. Once you and your loved one find products that work well, joining a subscription service can be helpful, since regular shipments will ensure you never run out of necessary supplies.For additional help, consider posting your question about incontinence products in the Caregiver Forum to receive answers from experienced members. If you are concerned about being able to afford incontinence supplies, consult the adult diaper bank directory compiled by the nonprofit Simon Foundation for Continence to find products and resources in your area. Incontinence supplies can be expensive, especially at the beginning when you’re buying multiple brands and styles to find the best possible solution. Try not to look at the price tags first and choose contenders based on the factors above instead. You may find that a pricier product is more durable and provides better protection, therefore requiring fewer changes and costing less in the long run. (Better absorption and protection can also prevent you from constantly having to launder soiled clothes and linens and clean furniture and floors.) Keep in mind that many incontinence product manufacturers offer free or low-cost samples and coupons that can help you through the discovery phase and defray costs once you settle on something you like.Caregiver Tips for Choosing Adult Incontinence BriefsSince there are so many factors that play into finding the “best” incontinence underwear, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, family caregivers can learn a great deal from one another by sharing real experiences and insights that help shorten the trial-and-error process. The following tips are real pieces of advice that have been shared on the Caregiver Forum.“I searched the Internet and got sample packs from various brands. Some were free samples, some I had to pay a nominal fee for, but getting the samples allowed me to visually see how they fit [without having to buy a whole package]. We ended up with Tranquility Premium OverNight Disposable Absorbent Underwear (pull-on style) for Dad. Tranquility also offers inserts that give an extra layer of protection used in conjunction with the regular disposable underwear. No underwear is going to be 100% leak-proof, but it is rare that Dad leaks with the Tranquility Premium OverNights. It’s worth the extra money.” –4him4Him“[Adult incontinence briefs] shouldn’t leak, but they do. A key issue is if the diaper/pull-up/brief has been peed in prior—even a little. The gel-like substance that is supposed to absorb won’t a second time. Nighttime is problematic and the laying down position doesn’t help matters. Gravity just doesn’t work that way. My conclusions? Some brands work better than others but they ALL leak. Although some swear by doubling diapers, it’s a waste. Pad inserts help best, especially for men when you can adjust and aim when putting on. (Sorry, you know what I mean).” –Rainmom“My mom is tiny, so even the small size of Depend briefs don’t fit tightly enough around the leg holes and sometimes she leaks. At night, we put two Poise pads in her Depend, so that if she wets the top layer, we only have to remove that pad rather than change the whole set. During the day, she wears one Poise pad in a cotton brief, which is snug enough that she doesn’t leak.” –CatyRay“My Dad wears the Depend ‘Real Fit’ incontinence underwear for men, which he likes much better than the regular Depend. For women, I think they are called Depend ‘Silhouette.’ ” –freqflyer“I was given some diapers for my husband that were actually for women, but I used them and I found that they seemed to be a bit better than the men’s! It seemed they come up higher on his back.” –Cathy2014“NorthShore Care Supply’s AirSupreme Tab-Style briefs are super absorbent and, if they fit properly, don’t leak. It is all about the fit in the waist and the legs. Both should be snug, but not so tight as to make indentations on the skin.

It is all about the fit in the waist and the legs. Both should be snug, but not so tight as to make indentations on the skin. If your loved one has an unusual body type, like thinner legs and thicker waist, or vice versa, many incontinence supplies providers have a quiz or product finder tool on their websites to help consumers find the right product and fit.” –Chateau“Don’t get the pull-on type diapers for a bedridden patient. Get the ones with tape [or velcro] tabs on the sides.” –SueC1957“There are so many sizes and absorbencies available as well as many different brands that you should be able to find something your loved one likes. Take some time to check out the websites of brands like Depend, Always, Tena and whatever other products are easily available. They are full of information about their products and some even provide free/cheap samples and customer service help. If your loved one really can’t/won’t change frequently, then you will probably need to order one of the premium products. If you are going to add a pad to a brief for extra absorbency, you need to look for BOOSTER pads that don’t have the leak-proof backing. Unless you slash the outer layer on a traditional pad, nothing can pass though the soaked product other than what overflows around the edges. Lastly, most of us resist the pull ups because they cost a lot more, but I think they are the only way to contain bowel incontinence.” –cwillie“My mom (who is in bed or in her wheelchair at all times) uses a Walmart brand called Assurance Unisex Stretch Brief with tabs and adds a Certainty Women’s Bladder Control Pad in Ultimate Absorbency from Walgreens.

It’s often difficult for older adults to accept and deal with incontinence issues. Many try to ignore this new development and carry on with their lives, but a head-in-the-sand approach usually backfires, drawing more attention to their condition. There are ways to encourage a loved one to address this problem, but they require patience, understanding and a commitment to upholding your loved one’s dignity.Pro Tip: Strike the Word Diaper From Your Vocabulary“My parent won’t wear adult diapers and it drives me nuts!”This is a common complaint from family caregivers whose loved ones are suffering from incontinence, and I absolutely sympathize. However, one glaring piece of this sentence stands out to me: the word “diaper.”Figuring out how to talk to elderly parents about incontinence is difficult. The first thing I urge caregivers to do is think carefully about their word choices. Seniors often rebel against the word “diaper” as an adult of any age would—and for good reason. This term is typically associated with babies or toddlers who have yet to be toilet trained. What adult would take kindly to the word when it’s applied to them?To take it one step further, think about this. If you are a middle-aged woman who has had children, you’ve probably suffered from stress incontinence occasionally, meaning that you’ve leaked a little urine while coughing, sneezing or laughing. Perhaps you’ve even used a panty protector just in case. How would you feel if your significant other or a friend referred to this little protection as a diaper?Bottom line: diapers are for babies. No adult, regardless of their level of physical or mental disability, should be treated like a baby. Aging and age-related conditions already rob our loved ones of much of their independence and dignity. Our word choices and tone of voice may not seem that important, but communicating and providing care in ways that help our loved ones feel dignified is a game-changer—especially when it comes to promoting cooperation and boosting self-esteem.This may seem like nitpicking, but please refer to adult incontinence products with age-appropriate terms. Think along the lines of briefs, pads, underpants, pull-ups, the actual brand name (e.g., Depends)—anything you want. Just make your terminology respectful and you’ll have mastered the first step toward getting a senior to wear incontinence protection. I ask you to do this not only for the elder but also for yourself. Using respectful language will help remind you that you are caring for an adult who deserves to be treated as such.Read: “Elderspeak” Can Be Detrimental to Seniors’ Mental and Physical HealthDetermine the Underlying Cause of “Accidents”I’m aware that just changing the words you use isn’t going to magically solve the problem. When incontinence becomes even an occasional issue, it’s important for your loved one to see their doctor about it. It may be caused by something straightforward, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or an over active bladder (OAB), or a more serious underlying issue like prostate problems in men or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in women.Most likely, you’ve already helped your loved one seek medical attention for this issue. After testing to determine the type of incontinence they’re experiencing, their doctor may be able to recommend pelvic floor exercises, minor surgical procedures, or even medications that can help manage incontinence symptoms. Sometimes a second opinion from a urologist is a good idea. For seniors experiencing fecal incontinence, make an appointment with a gastroenterologist. If you can identify and treat what’s causing a loved one’s symptoms, then adult briefs and other protection might wind up being unnecessary.Deal With Elderly Incontinence Denial Head OnIf your loved one is still cognitively sound, but they simply prefer to live in denial about this new development in their health, try appealing to their sense of vanity. After all, pride is what keeps us in denial about many age-related changes. Our culture is guilty of ageism to the extent that many people go to extremes to appear as though they are winning this losing battle against time.Certainly, incontinence is very difficult to accept. However, if you, or a third party, can convince your elder that it’s much more embarrassing to smell like urine than it is to wear proper protection, you may get somewhere. Promise to work with them to find a comfortable, absorbent and low-profile solution that will enable them to maintain their dignity, extend their independence and improve their appearance. Incontinence frequently causes seniors to withdraw and become less active so they can avoid embarrassing situations, but it doesn’t have to be this way.Browse Our Free  Senior Care GuidesAsk Their Doctor or a Friend for HelpJust like many other issues with our aging parents, incontinence may be better approached by a non-family member, such as a trusted friend or doctor. Why? Because seniors tend to discredit or shrug off observations and suggestions from their own family, especially when it’s coming from an adult child.Our aging parents changed our diapers when we were babies. It’s difficult for them to grapple with the fact that Mother Nature has pulled this cruel switch on them. Receiving advice and directions on “how to cope” from someone you raised and who has no first-hand experience with the issue is often just too much to handle. Seniors typically react by getting dismissive or defensive, which helps no one.It may be less embarrassing to have the discussion with an objective doctor who’s “seen it all before” or a friend who is dealing with the same challenges. When their defenses are down, they’re usually more willing to listen.Why Seniors Refuse to Wear Adult DiapersThere are plenty of other reasons that can make it difficult (if not impossible) to get an elder to wear incontinence underwear. Some of these factors are out of their control, and it can take a great deal of patience on behalf of their family caregivers to work through them.Diminished Senses of Sight and SmellOur senses weaken naturally with age and can result in a lack of awareness of how smelly and soiled one’s clothing and furniture are. Even if a senior acknowledges that they’ve had an accident, they may downplay it and continue wearing the same clothing (wet or dry) when it desperately needs to be laundered. Since they don’t realize the full impact that incontinence has on their personal presentation, they may truly feel that incontinence protection is unnecessary, especially if they don’t leave the house or have visitors often.It’s a difficult subject to broach, but informing a loved one that their body odor or the smell in their home has become offensive is sometimes the ticket to compliance with incontinence products. Some elders are truly embarrassed when they realize that others have caught onto the issue they thought they’d been successfully covering up. Just be sure to break the news gently and respectfully.DepressionIf your loved one feels no embarrassment or concern over their smell or appearance, then you may have a more serious underlying issue on your hands. Unfortunately, loss of interest in personal care, socialization and other activities can be symptoms of depression.Spotting depression in seniors is tricky, but social isolation, chronic health conditions and pain put this demographic at a significantly higher risk. At the very least, depression screening should be part of your loved one’s annual visit to their primary care physician. If you notice the symptoms between visits, it’s important to make an appointment as soon as possible. Treating depression may help your loved one feel better and spur them to engage in personal care again, which, in turn, can boost their self-esteem and encourage them to venture out and socialize more.Cognitive DeclineIf denial, obliviousness and depression aren’t factors in your loved one’s refusal to partake in continence care, a dementia screening might be the next step. It doesn’t matter who tries to reason with them or how they go about it. If cognitive decline is a factor, a senior may no longer be capable of making sound decisions about wearing incontinence products, changing their clothing or other important self-care tasks. Make a doctor’s appointment for a full evaluation whenever new or worsening memory issues or signs of dementia appear. Early diagnosis is crucial for adequate planning and care.When All Else Fails, Let Them Work It OutI’m aware that there are times when none of the above tips will work for well-meaning family caregivers. Our elders are in charge of their lives and daily choices. While our gentle suggestions come from a good place, there is little we can do about issues like this while they are still competent to make their own decisions. Do what you can to get them medical help, treat them with respect and dignity, and then let go.Time may take care of the very things you pushed so hard to correct. Sometimes, when we leave people alone to work out their problems, they stop resisting and tackle them head on. However, if their living situation is extremely dire and you feel it constitutes elder self-neglect, call your local Adult Protective Services (APS) agency. A welfare check may be needed to make some positive changes in your loved one’s life. “My parent won’t wear adult diapers and it drives me nuts!”This is a common complaint from family caregivers whose loved ones are suffering from incontinence, and I absolutely sympathize.

If you can identify and treat what’s causing a loved one’s symptoms, then adult briefs and other protection might wind up being unnecessary.Deal With Elderly Incontinence Denial Head OnIf your loved one is still cognitively sound, but they simply prefer to live in denial about this new development in their health, try appealing to their sense of vanity. After all, pride is what keeps us in denial about many age-related changes. Our culture is guilty of ageism to the extent that many people go to extremes to appear as though they are winning this losing battle against time.Certainly, incontinence is very difficult to accept. However, if you, or a third party, can convince your elder that it’s much more embarrassing to smell like urine than it is to wear proper protection, you may get somewhere. Promise to work with them to find a comfortable, absorbent and low-profile solution that will enable them to maintain their dignity, extend their independence and improve their appearance. Incontinence frequently causes seniors to withdraw and become less active so they can avoid embarrassing situations, but it doesn’t have to be this way.Browse Our Free  Senior Care GuidesAsk Their Doctor or a Friend for HelpJust like many other issues with our aging parents, incontinence may be better approached by a non-family member, such as a trusted friend or doctor. Why? Because seniors tend to discredit or shrug off observations and suggestions from their own family, especially when it’s coming from an adult child.Our aging parents changed our diapers when we were babies. It’s difficult for them to grapple with the fact that Mother Nature has pulled this cruel switch on them. Receiving advice and directions on “how to cope” from someone you raised and who has no first-hand experience with the issue is often just too much to handle. Seniors typically react by getting dismissive or defensive, which helps no one.It may be less embarrassing to have the discussion with an objective doctor who’s “seen it all before” or a friend who is dealing with the same challenges. When their defenses are down, they’re usually more willing to listen.Why Seniors Refuse to Wear Adult DiapersThere are plenty of other reasons that can make it difficult (if not impossible) to get an elder to wear incontinence underwear. Some of these factors are out of their control, and it can take a great deal of patience on behalf of their family caregivers to work through them.Diminished Senses of Sight and SmellOur senses weaken naturally with age and can result in a lack of awareness of how smelly and soiled one’s clothing and furniture are. Even if a senior acknowledges that they’ve had an accident, they may downplay it and continue wearing the same clothing (wet or dry) when it desperately needs to be laundered. Since they don’t realize the full impact that incontinence has on their personal presentation, they may truly feel that incontinence protection is unnecessary, especially if they don’t leave the house or have visitors often.It’s a difficult subject to broach, but informing a loved one that their body odor or the smell in their home has become offensive is sometimes the ticket to compliance with incontinence products. Some elders are truly embarrassed when they realize that others have caught onto the issue they thought they’d been successfully covering up. Just be sure to break the news gently and respectfully.DepressionIf your loved one feels no embarrassment or concern over their smell or appearance, then you may have a more serious underlying issue on your hands. Unfortunately, loss of interest in personal care, socialization and other activities can be symptoms of depression.Spotting depression in seniors is tricky, but social isolation, chronic health conditions and pain put this demographic at a significantly higher risk. At the very least, depression screening should be part of your loved one’s annual visit to their primary care physician. If you notice the symptoms between visits, it’s important to make an appointment as soon as possible. Treating depression may help your loved one feel better and spur them to engage in personal care again, which, in turn, can boost their self-esteem and encourage them to venture out and socialize more.Cognitive DeclineIf denial, obliviousness and depression aren’t factors in your loved one’s refusal to partake in continence care, a dementia screening might be the next step. It doesn’t matter who tries to reason with them or how they go about it. If cognitive decline is a factor, a senior may no longer be capable of making sound decisions about wearing incontinence products, changing their clothing or other important self-care tasks. Make a doctor’s appointment for a full evaluation whenever new or worsening memory issues or signs of dementia appear. Early diagnosis is crucial for adequate planning and care.When All Else Fails, Let Them Work It OutI’m aware that there are times when none of the above tips will work for well-meaning family caregivers. Our elders are in charge of their lives and daily choices. While our gentle suggestions come from a good place, there is little we can do about issues like this while they are still competent to make their own decisions. Do what you can to get them medical help, treat them with respect and dignity, and then let go.Time may take care of the very things you pushed so hard to correct. Sometimes, when we leave people alone to work out their problems, they stop resisting and tackle them head on. However, if their living situation is extremely dire and you feel it constitutes elder self-neglect, call your local Adult Protective Services (APS) agency. A welfare check may be needed to make some positive changes in your loved one’s life. Figuring out how to talk to elderly parents about incontinence is difficult. The first thing I urge caregivers to do is think carefully about their word choices. Seniors often rebel against the word “diaper” as an adult of any age would—and for good reason. This term is typically associated with babies or toddlers who have yet to be toilet trained. What adult would take kindly to the word when it’s applied to them?To take it one step further, think about this. If you are a middle-aged woman who has had children, you’ve probably suffered from stress incontinence occasionally, meaning that you’ve leaked a little urine while coughing, sneezing or laughing. Perhaps you’ve even used a panty protector just in case. How would you feel if your significant other or a friend referred to this little protection as a diaper?Bottom line: diapers are for babies. No adult, regardless of their level of physical or mental disability, should be treated like a baby. Aging and age-related conditions already rob our loved ones of much of their independence and dignity. Our word choices and tone of voice may not seem that important, but communicating and providing care in ways that help our loved ones feel dignified is a game-changer—especially when it comes to promoting cooperation and boosting self-esteem.This may seem like nitpicking, but please refer to adult incontinence products with age-appropriate terms. Think along the lines of briefs, pads, underpants, pull-ups, the actual brand name (e.g., Depends)—anything you want. Just make your terminology respectful and you’ll have mastered the first step toward getting a senior to wear incontinence protection. I ask you to do this not only for the elder but also for yourself. Using respectful language will help remind you that you are caring for an adult who deserves to be treated as such.Read: “Elderspeak” Can Be Detrimental to Seniors’ Mental and Physical HealthDetermine the Underlying Cause of “Accidents”I’m aware that just changing the words you use isn’t going to magically solve the problem. When incontinence becomes even an occasional issue, it’s important for your loved one to see their doctor about it. It may be caused by something straightforward, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or an over active bladder (OAB), or a more serious underlying issue like prostate problems in men or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in women.Most likely, you’ve already helped your loved one seek medical attention for this issue.

Sometimes a second opinion from a urologist is a good idea. For seniors experiencing fecal incontinence, make an appointment with a gastroenterologist. If you can identify and treat what’s causing a loved one’s symptoms, then adult briefs and other protection might wind up being unnecessary.Deal With Elderly Incontinence Denial Head OnIf your loved one is still cognitively sound, but they simply prefer to live in denial about this new development in their health, try appealing to their sense of vanity. After all, pride is what keeps us in denial about many age-related changes. Our culture is guilty of ageism to the extent that many people go to extremes to appear as though they are winning this losing battle against time.Certainly, incontinence is very difficult to accept. However, if you, or a third party, can convince your elder that it’s much more embarrassing to smell like urine than it is to wear proper protection, you may get somewhere. Promise to work with them to find a comfortable, absorbent and low-profile solution that will enable them to maintain their dignity, extend their independence and improve their appearance. Incontinence frequently causes seniors to withdraw and become less active so they can avoid embarrassing situations, but it doesn’t have to be this way.Browse Our Free  Senior Care GuidesAsk Their Doctor or a Friend for HelpJust like many other issues with our aging parents, incontinence may be better approached by a non-family member, such as a trusted friend or doctor. Why? Because seniors tend to discredit or shrug off observations and suggestions from their own family, especially when it’s coming from an adult child.Our aging parents changed our diapers when we were babies. It’s difficult for them to grapple with the fact that Mother Nature has pulled this cruel switch on them. Receiving advice and directions on “how to cope” from someone you raised and who has no first-hand experience with the issue is often just too much to handle. Seniors typically react by getting dismissive or defensive, which helps no one.It may be less embarrassing to have the discussion with an objective doctor who’s “seen it all before” or a friend who is dealing with the same challenges. When their defenses are down, they’re usually more willing to listen.Why Seniors Refuse to Wear Adult DiapersThere are plenty of other reasons that can make it difficult (if not impossible) to get an elder to wear incontinence underwear. Some of these factors are out of their control, and it can take a great deal of patience on behalf of their family caregivers to work through them.Diminished Senses of Sight and SmellOur senses weaken naturally with age and can result in a lack of awareness of how smelly and soiled one’s clothing and furniture are. Even if a senior acknowledges that they’ve had an accident, they may downplay it and continue wearing the same clothing (wet or dry) when it desperately needs to be laundered. Since they don’t realize the full impact that incontinence has on their personal presentation, they may truly feel that incontinence protection is unnecessary, especially if they don’t leave the house or have visitors often.It’s a difficult subject to broach, but informing a loved one that their body odor or the smell in their home has become offensive is sometimes the ticket to compliance with incontinence products. Some elders are truly embarrassed when they realize that others have caught onto the issue they thought they’d been successfully covering up. Just be sure to break the news gently and respectfully.DepressionIf your loved one feels no embarrassment or concern over their smell or appearance, then you may have a more serious underlying issue on your hands. Unfortunately, loss of interest in personal care, socialization and other activities can be symptoms of depression.Spotting depression in seniors is tricky, but social isolation, chronic health conditions and pain put this demographic at a significantly higher risk. At the very least, depression screening should be part of your loved one’s annual visit to their primary care physician. If you notice the symptoms between visits, it’s important to make an appointment as soon as possible. Treating depression may help your loved one feel better and spur them to engage in personal care again, which, in turn, can boost their self-esteem and encourage them to venture out and socialize more.Cognitive DeclineIf denial, obliviousness and depression aren’t factors in your loved one’s refusal to partake in continence care, a dementia screening might be the next step. It doesn’t matter who tries to reason with them or how they go about it. If cognitive decline is a factor, a senior may no longer be capable of making sound decisions about wearing incontinence products, changing their clothing or other important self-care tasks. Make a doctor’s appointment for a full evaluation whenever new or worsening memory issues or signs of dementia appear. Early diagnosis is crucial for adequate planning and care.When All Else Fails, Let Them Work It OutI’m aware that there are times when none of the above tips will work for well-meaning family caregivers. Our elders are in charge of their lives and daily choices. While our gentle suggestions come from a good place, there is little we can do about issues like this while they are still competent to make their own decisions. Do what you can to get them medical help, treat them with respect and dignity, and then let go.Time may take care of the very things you pushed so hard to correct. Sometimes, when we leave people alone to work out their problems, they stop resisting and tackle them head on. However, if their living situation is extremely dire and you feel it constitutes elder self-neglect, call your local Adult Protective Services (APS) agency. A welfare check may be needed to make some positive changes in your loved one’s life. I’m aware that just changing the words you use isn’t going to magically solve the problem.

When their defenses are down, they’re usually more willing to listen.Why Seniors Refuse to Wear Adult DiapersThere are plenty of other reasons that can make it difficult (if not impossible) to get an elder to wear incontinence underwear. Some of these factors are out of their control, and it can take a great deal of patience on behalf of their family caregivers to work through them.Diminished Senses of Sight and SmellOur senses weaken naturally with age and can result in a lack of awareness of how smelly and soiled one’s clothing and furniture are. Even if a senior acknowledges that they’ve had an accident, they may downplay it and continue wearing the same clothing (wet or dry) when it desperately needs to be laundered. Since they don’t realize the full impact that incontinence has on their personal presentation, they may truly feel that incontinence protection is unnecessary, especially if they don’t leave the house or have visitors often.It’s a difficult subject to broach, but informing a loved one that their body odor or the smell in their home has become offensive is sometimes the ticket to compliance with incontinence products. Some elders are truly embarrassed when they realize that others have caught onto the issue they thought they’d been successfully covering up. Just be sure to break the news gently and respectfully.DepressionIf your loved one feels no embarrassment or concern over their smell or appearance, then you may have a more serious underlying issue on your hands. Unfortunately, loss of interest in personal care, socialization and other activities can be symptoms of depression.Spotting depression in seniors is tricky, but social isolation, chronic health conditions and pain put this demographic at a significantly higher risk. At the very least, depression screening should be part of your loved one’s annual visit to their primary care physician. If you notice the symptoms between visits, it’s important to make an appointment as soon as possible. Treating depression may help your loved one feel better and spur them to engage in personal care again, which, in turn, can boost their self-esteem and encourage them to venture out and socialize more.Cognitive DeclineIf denial, obliviousness and depression aren’t factors in your loved one’s refusal to partake in continence care, a dementia screening might be the next step. It doesn’t matter who tries to reason with them or how they go about it. If cognitive decline is a factor, a senior may no longer be capable of making sound decisions about wearing incontinence products, changing their clothing or other important self-care tasks. Make a doctor’s appointment for a full evaluation whenever new or worsening memory issues or signs of dementia appear. Early diagnosis is crucial for adequate planning and care.When All Else Fails, Let Them Work It OutI’m aware that there are times when none of the above tips will work for well-meaning family caregivers. Our elders are in charge of their lives and daily choices.

Sometimes, when we leave people alone to work out their problems, they stop resisting and tackle them head on.

Fact Checked According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, at least half of older adults experience adult incontinence, which can include involuntarily leaking urine from the bladder and/or eliminating fecal matter from the bowel. Especially common in women, the condition is often caused by life events like pregnancy, childbirth and menopause. Wearing adult diapers or briefs can help those who are struggling with the condition navigate everyday life more simply. “Protection is paramount in this space,” says Steven G. Gregg, Ph.D., the executive director of the National Association for Continence. “And protection means that you are protected from leaks and accidents.” He’s a strong champion for protective products, such as pull-up briefs. “We love the freedom that they give people.” Though there’s a “massive stigma” around incontinence, Gregg notes, there shouldn’t be. Incontinence is a natural and common experience among adults. Still, picking the right product to help can make life with incontinence more enjoyable. To find the best adult diapers, the Forbes Health editorial team analyzed data on more than 90 products, factoring in price, sizes available, absorbency, adjustability and more.

Here’s what to know about the most popular options. Pull-ups are very similar to regular underwear, says Steven Z. Zeldes, CEO of AvaCare Medical in New Jersey. They’re pulled up onto your body and fit like any other pair of underwear. Pull-ups are usually more discreet and less bulky than adult briefs and come with multiple absorbency levels, often ranging from light to severe. “An adult brief is the same thing as a diaper,” says Zeldes, noting that the two terms are interchangeable. Briefs can be a good option for people with limited mobility who need help from a caregiver, since they’re easier to put on than pull-ups, which require taking the wearer’s pants off completely. Adult briefs typically have tab fasteners on the sides that can be undone or come with tear-away sides. They also tend to have higher absorbency levels than pull-up diapers, he notes. If you’re worried about the environment, you might prefer reusable adult diapers, which can be easily washed (instead of wearing and disposing of numerous diapers a day). Since you won’t need to refill your supply as often, reusable diapers can be a cost-effective option as well. Reusable diapers are often made out of a soft fabric that can be tossed into the washing machine, says Zeldes. However, because you’ll need to ensure you have a washed supply at the ready, this type of diaper can be less convenient. High Absorbency Underwear You Barely Feel Experience optimal absorbency, a sleek, invisible fit under clothes, and soft, breathable material with Because Market's premium underwear.  There are numerous factors to consider when choosing adult diapers, including the following. Some adult diapers have tabs that are fastened at the sides, says Zeldes. A caregiver can place a tabbed diaper directly underneath the person who’s wearing it, then fasten the tabs. This style often works well for people who aren’t very mobile, he says, since putting them on doesn’t require removing the wearer’s pants. Meanwhile, pull-ups are—as their name suggests—pulled up like normal underwear. They’re usually best for more mobile patients, says Zeldes, since putting them on requires taking off pants. Finding adult diapers that are the right size and fit is crucial, says Zeldes. Otherwise, “it’s almost worthless” and will cause leakage, he adds. Diapers with tabs are a bit easier to fit because you can loosen or tighten them to fit a person. Pull-ups are slightly more difficult to size correctly, as they can’t be adjusted, he says. When it comes to absorption level, some diapers are more absorbent than others, says Zeldes. There are generally four levels of absorbency: There are two main types of backing material: cloth and plastic. Plastic-backed diapers are typically more absorbent, says Zeldes, but they may be less comfortable than cloth diapers. Some adult diapers have built-in odor control. Check the brand’s packaging to see what it offers. Many products utilize odor-control technology that neutralizes the pH of urine, adds Zeldes, which can help prevent a strong scent. Some diapers are intended for day use while others are absorbent enough to work well overnight. “The nighttime ones are obviously more absorbent because during the night, there’s less control,” says Zeldes. He notes that the more absorbent an adult diaper is, the more expensive the product tends to be. If you or a loved one uses adult diapers, there are a number of additional products you should consider keeping on hand, says Zeldes, including: Adult diaper rash, also known as adult diaper dermatitis, happens when urine or feces irritate and inflame the skin due to incontinence and adult diaper use. “I typically recommend that patients start with a good barrier cream as prevention,” says Daniel Grabell, M.D., a dermatologist at Princeton Dermatology Associates in New Jersey. “If there’s itching, seeing a dermatologist can help determine if there’s a fungal component,” which might necessitate prescription medication. In many cases, diaper rash can be treated successfully at home. Try applying a zinc oxide diaper cream, especially if the skin remains red throughout the day.
